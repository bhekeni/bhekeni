- 👋 Hi, I’m @bhekeni
- 👀 I’m interested in Web 3.0
- 🌱 I’m currently learning where to start with Web 3.0 development and how to find developers to help me realise my project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an NFT project that innovates the P2E space. I don't want to go for the typical cash grab I want to create something useful, fun and profitable for both the users and the project.
